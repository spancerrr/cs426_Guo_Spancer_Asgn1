I'm from China, and I think when people think about China they will think Chinese Kungfu. 
So the main idea of my game is to simulate a backyard of a Chinese temple where people can learn Kungfu.

The 2D texture I used in the game for the walls, the rocks, the grass, and the wood is downloaded from the unity store.
The scripts I used in the game are provided by the instructor, as well as the bb8 charactor.
